        <li>
          Hello! My name is Vignesh Vasanth C</li>
          <li> As a software engineer with 6
          years of experience in front-end development, I possess a strong skill
          set in various tools and technologies such as Angular, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, SCSS,
          Bootstrap, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          With my knowledge of Angular, I can create complex web applications
          that are highly interactive and responsive. Angular is a popular
          front-end framework that uses a declarative approach to building user
          interfaces, which makes it easier to write clean and maintainable code.
        </li>
        <li>
          My proficiency in HTML and CSS allows me to design and style web
          pages with ease, making them visually appealing and accessible.
          Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework like SCSS, Less, Tailwind CSS, helps you to create responsive web
          designs that are compatible with different screen sizes and devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          My expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript enables you to write
          powerful and efficient client-side scripts that can manipulate the
          Document Object Model (DOM) and provide interactivity to web pages.
          TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, adds features such as static
          typing and class-based object-oriented programming, making it easier to
          write scalable and maintainable code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall, your skills and experience as a front-end developer make you a
          valuable asset to any software development team.
